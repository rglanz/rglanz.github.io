This responsive portfolio website was [originally written](https://github.com/bedimcode/responsive-mini-portfolio) in HTML/CSS/JS.

This implementation is cloned from my [generic template](https://github.com/rglanz/react-mini-portfolio).

### Readability and Functional Improvements

- Refactored the original HTML file into JSX and split the code up into several React components
- Created databases for Projects and Skills items to keep the components DRY
- Implemented the light/dark theme and Projects/Skills rocker functionalities using React State Hooks rather than pure JS
